## 关于 Quandl

Quandl 是一个针对金融投资行业的大数据平台，其数据来源包括联合国、世界银行、中央银行等公开数据，核心财务数据来自 CLS 集团，Zacks 和 ICE 等，所有的数据源自 500 多家发布商， 是为投资专业人士提供金融，经济和替代数据的首选平台，拥有海量的经济和金融数据。

## Quandl 数据索引

### CovenantSQL 使用简介

首先，我们已基于 Quandl 的开放 API 将数据存放在 CovenantSQL 中，首先应该浏览一下 CovenantSQL 的使用介绍来熟悉一下如何连接并且使用 CovenantSQL。

现在由于客户端兼容问题， 请直接使用我们的 HTTP 服务来对 Quandl 数据库进行 query，未来兼容现在的 `cql` 客户端后会第一时间更新此文档。

具体通过 HTTP 服务来使用 CovenantSQL 请参考 [Python 驱动文档](https://github.com/CovenantSQL/python-driver/blob/master/README.rst) 和 [NodeJS 驱动文档](https://github.com/CovenantSQL/node-covenantsql/blob/master/README.md)

所需参数:

```
host: 'e.morenodes.com'
port: 11108
database: '057e55460f501ad071383c95f691293f2f0a7895988e22593669ceeb52a6452a'
```

### 数据使用方法

Quandl 数据分为表以及子表两层索引

数据库中，表名为`quandl_` + `database_code`为完整表名

通过查询表名来查看表的内容

具体使用时，需要结合`quandl_updateindex` 这张索引表来使用，（查询索引表时，请务必 limit 小于 10 万，因为全表数据量过大）

使用时，请使用 where 语句限定`quandlcode`字段来查询表中的子表数据。

### 查询示例

1. 我们想要查询 欧盟委员会年度宏观经济数据库 的数据，我们找到其第一层索引的 `databasecode` 为`quandl_ameco`，于是，我们可以查询其第二层索引，用以下 SQL 命令行：

   `select * from quandl_updateindex where databasecode like 'ameco' group by quandlcode limit 10000`

2. 然后通过第三列，我们可以查看`quandlcode`对应的描述

   比如 AMECO/ALB_1_0_0_0_AAGE 对应的就是阿尔巴尼亚的进出口相关信息，时间从 1960 到 1988。

   <u>Average share of imports and exports of goods in world trade excluding intra EU trade; Foreign trade statistics (1960-1998 Former EU-15) - Albania</u>

   于是，我们可以用以下方式把这个子表给查询出来

   `select * from quandl_ameco where quandlcode like 'AMECO/ALB_1_0_0_0_AAGE' limit 10000`

3. 注意：如果内容整列为 null 的，属于表结构本身不存在的字段，可以自行去除。

## Quandl 数据 Excel 插件使用说明

您可以下载 Quandl 数据 Excel 插件，无须安装，请解压到任意文件夹中。此插件目前仅支持 Office 2010 以及以上版本，office 2007 以及以下版本目前暂不支持。

### 配置 Excel 插件

解压下载后压缩包，在文件夹中有两个.xll 文件，`ClassLibrary7-AddIn.xll` 以及 `ClassLibrary7-AddIn64.xll` 文件，这两个文件分别对应 32 位的 Excel 与 64 位的 Excel，请根据您的电脑配置使用对应插件。

#### 修改 xml 配置

每个 `.xll` 文件对应一个 `.config` 的配置文件，也就是 `ClassLibrary7-AddIn.xll.config` 和`ClassLibrary7-AddIn64.xll.config`，为如下 xml 配置：

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="certpath" value="C:\Cert\read.data.thunderdb.io.pfx" />
    <add key="keypassword" value="covenantsql" />
    <add key="url" value="https://e.morenodes.com:11108/v1/query" />
    <add key="database" value="057e55460f501ad071383c95f691293f2f0a7895988e22593669ceeb52a6452a" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

其中有如下配置需要修改，并保存：

- certpath: 请填写 `read.data.thunderdb.io.pfx` 证书的绝对路径

#### 安装插件

有两种办法使用此 Excel 插件

1. 直接双击对应的 32 位或 64 位 Excel 的 xll 文件打开

![quandl_ext_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CovenantSQL/cql-excel-extension/master/refs/quandl_ext_1.png)

如果弹出如上对话框，选择第一个： `仅为本回话启用此加载项`。然后新建一个 Excel 表格，如果在 Excel 的上方选项卡中看到 CovenantSQL，说明插件加载成功。

2. 打开 Excel，然后依次选择 `文件 — 选项 — 加载项`，管理选择 Excel 加载项，点击转到然后浏览选择解压后的对应版本的 `.xll` 文件，然后点击 `确定`，在选项卡中如果成功加载出 CovenantSQL 即为成功加载，如下图：

![quandl_ext_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CovenantSQL/cql-excel-extension/master/refs/quandl_ext_2.png)

#### 使用插件

选择 CovenantSQL 的选项卡可以看到 Quandl 数据查询，点击 Quandl 数据查询，会弹出一个窗体如下图所示：

![quandl_ext_3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CovenantSQL/cql-excel-extension/master/refs/quandl_ext_3.png)

- 其中红色框住的列表部分是一级目录，下方则是所选项的具体描述

- 绿色按钮是通过选择的一级目录来查询二级目录。这里查询时间会随着所查询二级目录的大小以及用户自身的网络速度等因素而不同，可能查询时间会超过 1 分钟，请耐心等待。

- 黄色部分左边的列表是二级目录，右边的窗体则为列表项所选择的表的描述。

- 蓝色部分是导出数据的可选项
  - Limit Number 是一次导出的最多数据条数，默认为 10000 条，最大值可填写 100000
  - Offset Number 是从数据库的第几条开始导出，因为之前会限定条数，例如我们之前导出了 10000 条数据，但是明显数据还没有导出全部，我们可以使用此功能选择 offset 10000 来从第 10000 条开始导出（注：数据库的计数从 0 开始，所以前 10000 条为 0-9999）

现在，您即可在 Excel 中方便的调用存在 CovenantSQL 上的 Quandl 数据。
